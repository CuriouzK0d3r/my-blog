            </div>If you are a web developer you probably have… developed a love-and-hate relationship with JavaScript.
While it is a feature-rich and constantly evolving language, it has some limitations. Especially when it comes to complex applications it may fall short.
A popular solution chosen among developers is using a different language that gets compiled to JavaScript. This can be achieved with a tool called transpiler. A transpiler is essentially a compiler that transforms a language’s code to another high-level language code (not an assembly language).]]></description>

            </div>Embracing the hype Nowadays, everyone is talking about Artificial Intelligence. Whether understands it or not. This discussion essentially comes down to two terms: Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.
Deep Learning is a type of Machine Learning based on Artificial Neural Networks with multiple layers.
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.]]></description>
