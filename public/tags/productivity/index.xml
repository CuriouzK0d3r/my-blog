            </div>Online social networks Whoever knows me personally is aware that I am not the biggest fan of social networks. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I was always involved with them. Understanding social networks was also part of my research interests for a quite long time. But my relationship with them was always a love and hate one.
In this blog, I&rsquo;m going to talk a lot about this relationship.
In this post, though I will diverge from this discussion.]]></description>

And that was supposed to be a good thing, due to its openness and the freedom that it was providing. But freedom and control are relative concepts.
Web now has become bloated with unnecessary code, advertisements, pop-ups, comments and recommendation systems that are trying to mine our data and keep us hooked in their user interfaces by providing us with constants hits of dopamine.]]></description>

The weather is good and you are enjoying this relaxing day. Suddenly, you hear a beeping sound. It’s your phone notifying you of a new message. You text back and you put your phone back in your pocket.
