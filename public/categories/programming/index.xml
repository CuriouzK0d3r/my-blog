            </div>If you are a web developer you probably have… developed a love-and-hate relationship with JavaScript.
While it is a feature-rich and constantly evolving language, it has some limitations. Especially when it comes to complex applications it may fall short.
A popular solution chosen among developers is using a different language that gets compiled to JavaScript. This can be achieved with a tool called transpiler. A transpiler is essentially a compiler that transforms a language’s code to another high-level language code (not an assembly language).]]></description>

            </div>Level of knowledge required: This article requires some programming background to be fully understood.
Introduction I am sure you have noticed the silly syntax in this article&rsquo;s title. It is inspired by a popular introductory book for the Haskell language, called “Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!” [1]. Which could probably be perceived as “Learn Haskell for great benefit”. Haskell is one of the so-called purely functional programming languages. Or more precisely, almost purely functional.]]></description>
