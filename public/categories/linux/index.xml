            </div>Online social networks Whoever knows me personally is aware that I am not the biggest fan of social networks. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I was always involved with them. Understanding social networks was also part of my research interests for a quite long time. But my relationship with them was always a love and hate one.

            </div>The bloated web I recall a few years ago me sharing Mozillaâ€™s dream for the web. The web was on its way to become the main platform for internet users. And that was supposed to be a good thing, due to its openness and the freedom that it was providing. But freedom and control are relative concepts.
Web now has become bloated with unnecessary code, advertisements, pop-ups, comments and recommendation systems that are trying to mine our data and keep us hooked in their user interfaces by providing us with constants hits of dopamine.]]></description>
