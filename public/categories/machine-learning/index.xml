            </div>Embracing the hype Nowadays, everyone is talking about Artificial Intelligence. Whether understands it or not. This discussion essentially comes down to two terms: Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.
Deep Learning is a type of Machine Learning based on Artificial Neural Networks with multiple layers.
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.]]></description>

            </div>Some History Disinformation is not a recent issue. As Guardian columnist Natalie Nougayr`ede has observed: ”The use of propaganda is ancient, but never before has there been the technology to so effectively disseminate it” [1].
Misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda have been features of human communication since at least the Roman times [2]. However, the invention of the Gutenberg printing press in 1493 dramatically amplified the dissemination of disinformation and misinformation, and it ultimately delivered the first large-scale news hoax - ’The Great Moon Hoax’ of 1835.]]></description>
