            </div>Embracing the hype Nowadays, everyone is talking about Artificial Intelligence. Whether understands it or not. This discussion essentially comes down to two terms: Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data.
Deep Learning is a type of Machine Learning based on Artificial Neural Networks with multiple layers.
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains.]]></description>
